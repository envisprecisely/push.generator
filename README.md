# push.generator
A dynamic 3D avatar generator

## What is this?
Written for the generative corporate design of [push.conference](http://push-conference.com), the generator will create graphics out of letters you type.

## How do I use it?
After cloning the repository, you need to compile the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and then open index.html in your Browser of choice.

Run this command to compile (and automatically recompile upon code changes):
```
coffee -wcj js/push-application.js coffee/*.coffee
```
